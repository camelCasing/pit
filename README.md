# üêç pit
simple python implementation of git


**Info:**
I actually do not have git and have never used it so this is what limited knowledge of the program I have and will try to emulate to the best of my ability, since this is in Python it may be slower but a significant size difference (smaller)


 **Usage:**
 
 python - ```pit.py clone <repo url>```
 
 exe - ```pit clone <repo url>```
