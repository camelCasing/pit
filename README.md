# üêç pit
simple python implementation of git


**Info:**

I actually do not have git and have never used it so this is what limited knowledge of the program I have and will try to emulate to the best of my ability, since this is in Python it may be slower but a significant size difference (smaller)


**Usage:**
 
make sure you either have a system envrioment variable set to the location of pit or your working directory is in the same directory as the pit you are using
 
python:

```pit.py clone <repo url> <output>```

```pit.py help```


exe:
 
```pit clone <repo url> <output>```
 
```pit help```
